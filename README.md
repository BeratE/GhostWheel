# GhostWheel
Experimental Isomentric 2.D Game Engine written in Lua for the [Playdate](https://play.date/) SDK, able to load level data created in the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

A playable prototype engine for creating isometric, physics-enabled 2.5D levels, using JSON data exported from the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
Designed with an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, this engine empowers non-technical level designers to quickly prototype and test game levels using only Tiled.

The ultimate goal is to allow designers to:
* Rapidly prototype isometric levels
* Define rich game logic with no code
* Use pre-rendered visuals for final levels after testing
* Focus on gameplay, not engine internals

> üöß **_ Note:_** : This engine is experimental and under active development. Expect bugs and incomplete features.


## üó∫ Level Editing in Tiled
Levels are created entirely in the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/), using JSON export format. 
All core level data‚Äîcollision, visuals, player start, monsters, event zones, etc. are defined using custom properties on tiles, objects, and layers.

What You Can Define in Tiled:
| Feature	          | Defined Via                                                     |
| ------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layout & terrain  |	Tile layers                                                     |
| Player/Monsters	  | Object layers with custom properties (e.g. "player", "monster") |
| Collision	        | Object layers with "collision" component                        |
| Patrol paths      |	Object groups with waypoints                                    |
| Triggers & events	| Areas with "event" components                                   |
| Camera tracking	  | "cameratrack" property                                          |

### üìÅ Example Workflow
* Open Tiled
* Design your level using tile and object layers
* Add properties like "player", "event", "collision", "dialog", etc.
* Export the map as .json
* Load it into the game engine and test on Playdate or desktop

## üõ† Entity-Component-System Design
All entities (player, NPCs, items, triggers) are defined by their components, which are simple flags or attributes set in Tiled.
For example, a snippet of exported level data containing a "PlayerStart" object may look like this:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "name": "PlayerStart",
  "properties": {
    "player": true,
    "cameratrack": true,
    "collision": true
  }
}
```
The engine automatically builds this into a controllable player entity with camera tracking and collision detection.

## üéÆ Some Supported Featues
#### Map/Level Loading
* Load JSON files exported from Tiled Map Editor
*  Support Isometric grid data,
* (x, y) shift of map (for camera)
* Support multiple layers
* Support multiple tilesets
* Support multiple levels (height differences)
* Support different map width/height
* Support layer properties
* Support image layers
### Rendering & Physics
* Render Tiled Map Data
* Translate 2D Position coordinates to 2.5d isometric coordinates
* Translation from top-down (physics) to isometric (render) (see Isometric)
* Axis-Aligned collision detection in 2d position space
* Rigid-Body physics collision response
* Velocity Verlet Integration with velocity and acceleration
* Impulses using forces
* Resistance to movement (linear damping)
* Finetunable feel (force, damping, mass)

## üß™ Current Limitations / Unsupported Features
* ‚ùå No animation system yet
* ‚ùå No event trigger logic (in progress)
* ‚ùå No UI/Dialog/Inventory/Item systems (planned)
* ‚ùå No visual scripting for triggers
* ‚ùå No support for hexagonal maps or staggered projections

## üõ† Immediate To-Do
* Basic animation support
* Trigger system for events
* Items and inventory system
* Doors to other rooms/levels
* Dialog system
